## Riding in April
Today I ride bike from subway station to my workplace, there are so many catkins in air, which makes lots of riders hard to keep eyes open...while i feel so good and 
no bother at all, actually it's the first time that I am grateful to my small eyes.

Normally i think people who wear black socks are rude, and those who wear white are gentle. But what about wearing white to black, emmm... I think they are lousy.

## 臭狗
我有一门课，助教的微信名叫“臭狗”，听起来很有意思...
